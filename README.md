*STUDENT PROJECT*

This is a battle game that is displayed on the terminal. The player fights the enemy, and the powers he possesses are classic attacks and spells like: 
Fire, Blizzard, Meteor, Thunder, and Cure. Each of those spells has a specific power and cost. Whenever a player uses magic, it reduces the player's Magic Point 
depending on which one they chose. Also player and enemy have their own Health Points.
